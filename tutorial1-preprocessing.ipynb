The RADAR pipeline is a computational framework designed to identify m6A-modified regions in RNA, specifically focusing on high-throughput MeRIP-seq data analysis, and we will use it for downstream analysis in the next tutorial. The dataset includes six omental tumor tissues and seven normal fallopian tube tissues, and both input and m6A immunoprecipation libraries were sequenced by the NextSeq 500 platform at PE37 mode (pair-end, 37bp). \n",

This region was chosen to include the **HRAS** gene, which is a key gene implicated in cancer progression and is regulated by m6A methylation. The HRAS gene is highlighted in another study ([Pan, Yongbo, et al.  PNAS (2023)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2302291120)), which demonstrates how m6A modifications on HRAS RNA influence tumor progression, making it a biologically relevant region for studying m6A methylation.\n",

It is a collection of command line programs for UNIX-style operating systems written mostly in Perl and C++, although some functionality requires additional tools to be installed as well (e.g. samtools, R, etc.). HOMER was primarily written as a de novo motif discovery algorithm and is well suited for finding 8-20 bp motifs in large scale genomics data.

During the creation of tag directories, several quality control routines are run to help provide information and feedback about the quality of the experiment. During this phase several important parameters are estimated that are later used for downstream analysis, such as the estimated length of MeRIP-Seq fragments.\n",

This motif is commonly found in **3' UTRs** and near **stop codons**, playing a crucial role in post-transcriptional gene regulation by influencing RNA stability, splicing, and translation efficiency. Highly conserved across species, RRACH is a primary target for m6A methylation and dynamically regulated in response to cellular conditions. \n",

    "The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is an interactive tool for the visual exploration of genomic data. It supports flexible integration of all the common types of genomic data and metadata. IGV supports many different file formats, such as .bam, .bed, GFF/GTF, .fasta. For a full list of file formats IGV supported, please visit https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/FileFormats.\n",
    "\n",
    "IGV can be downloaded as a desktop application, and it also has a JavaScript version that can embed IGV in the web apps. The igv-notebook we are going to use in this tutorial is a Python package which wraps igv.js for embedding it in an IPython notebook.\n",

    "+ **Peak Calling and Annotation**: Using HOMER for peak calling and motif discovery, helping us identify regions enriched in m6A modifications.\n",
    "+ **Data Visualization**: Using IGV for exploring alignment files, coverage, and peaks, providing a comprehensive view of the MeRIP-seq data.\n",
    "+ **BigWig and BAM Manipulations**: Converting alignment files and coverage tracks into formats suitable for visualization, merging replicates for more streamlined analysis.\n",
    "By following these steps, you now have a full understanding of the MeRIP-seq data preprocessing pipeline and can apply similar workflows to your own datasets for robust RNA methylation analysis."
