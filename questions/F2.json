        "back": " A joint peak set ensures consistency across samples, avoids false positives caused by variations in individual peak calls, and allows quantitative comparisons of methylation levels across conditions."

        "back": " RADAR directly performs differential methylation analysis without requiring explicit peak calling, relying instead on transcript-wide bin quantification."
